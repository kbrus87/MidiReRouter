# Welcome to MidiRouter

The objective of this simple vst is to provide and easier way to reroute midi notes.
Ever tried to use a drum midi pack made for a specific virtual drum but you'd prefer if you could use another but they dont translate? and rerouting is a pain?

Well this will attempt to give you a hand with the rerouting.

# How to
You can do it by hand writting the notes in the input and the desired output.
You can also load a drumkit map with the button "Load Input Drumkit" and it will create the input mapping required with the names provided. (this works with drum map obtained from Reaper Stash)

Then if you have a specific drum vst in  mind you can load the map for the output with "Load Output Drumkit" and it will allow you to select the piece you want to activate.

Also you can activate or deactivate the routing disabling the midi note or if you dont set an ouput note and the block is active then the note is bypassed and it will come out as it came in.

Hopefully this will be helpful to some of you.

# Legal things
I have a license from Steinberg and VST3 technology is all their work. 
I think somehow im supposed to say that somewhere.
